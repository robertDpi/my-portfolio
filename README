Portfolio Website
=================
This project is meant for web developers, photographers, and people who want a simple portfolio online and have a basic understanding of the Ruby on Rails framework.

It has three major sections...

* Projects
* About
* Contact

Projects
---------
This is a simple CRUD where you can log in through visiting */users/sign_in* and start creating, updating and deleting your projects online. Each project has a title, subtitle, description, cover and associated captioned screenshots.

About
---------
This is a plain static page you can modify at *app/views/pages/about.html.erb*

Contact
---------
This is a simple contact form based on Greg Pollack's Rails Best Practices, it sends emails directly not saving them in the DB.


This is a lovingly hand-coded open-source branch of my own portfolio website, so please feel free to modify it, add your own styles and drop me a link once it's done! :) It will be very much appreciated... Enjoy!
